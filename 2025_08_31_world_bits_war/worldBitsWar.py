# Variation of this nice kata, the war has expanded and become dirtier and meaner;
# both even and odd numbers will fight with their pointy 1s. And negative integers
# are coming into play as well, with, Ã§a va sans dire, a negative contribution
# (think of them as spies or saboteurs).

# A number's strength is determined by the number of set bits (1s) in its binary
# representation. Negative integers work against their own side so their strength
# is negative. For example -5 = -101 has strength -2 and +5 = +101 has strength +2.

# The side with the largest cumulated strength wins.

# Again, three possible outcomes: odds win, evens win and tie.

# Examples:

# [1,5,12]    => "odds win"  //   1 + 101 vs 1100,         3 vs 2
# [7,-3,20]   => "evens win" // 111 - 11  vs 10100,    3 - 2 vs 2
# [7,-3,-2,6] => "tie"       // 111 - 11  vs -1 + 110,  3 - 2 vs -1 + 2

# binary_digits = bin(10)[2:]
# print(binary_digits)  # Output: '1010'

# # Using format()
# print(format(10, 'b'))  # Output: '1010'

# # Using f-string
# print(f"{10:b}")        # Output: '1010'

# binary_str = '1010'
# integer = int(binary_str, 2)
# print(integer)  # Output: 10
